                    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-4">When to use</h2>
                    <p>The redesigned GDS jumplinks should only typically be used in places where that standard GDS link list design doesn't envoke enough user engagement. This updated design should always be tested against the original to provide proof that the updated version is beneficial when your product is assessed.</p>
                    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Research</h2>
                    <p>In order to get to a conclusive state that this design provided the best engagement for users, without distracting from the content itself, it went through AB testing on the BAU service. The details and results of those can be found on <a href="https://skillsfundingagency.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DFC/pages/324698399/A+B+Testing+Plan+Sprint+26+27">Confluence</a>.</p>
                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Background</h3>
                    <p>Links to individual sections were introduced after users described how they would like to be aware of what is the page about and being able to go straight to a relevant section. Grey background was introduced after a number of users missed the section to increase prominence.</p>
                    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Research findings</h3>
                    <p>Overall based on qualitative research there was an evident need for the jump links and we tested a number of iterations for example having the jump links on the side as sticky and reached the current state as is. Based on analytics we observed that a number of people clicked on them to go straight to that section but not as much as we expected. The  majority of users still preferred to scroll through the page both in desktop and mobile.</p>
