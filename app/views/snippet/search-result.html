<h2>When to use</h2>
<p>This snippet should be used when further information is seen as being beneficial to the citizen when using search. As with all enhancements on the GDS patterns, this will need to be backed up by appropriate user research.</p>
<p>There are three additional pieces of information being displayed here, the alternative title, salary and category links. You can adapt and remove these where neccessary to suit the content you wish to provide.</p>

<h2>Research</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>As a standard, search results include the main bit of information a user might be looking for and potentially a small description of it. In our case, users expressed the need to have more information before they decide to go through reading about a job. That comes as a need to browse and get inspired looking a number of profiles before selecting what they would like to explore further. Users insist on the value of salary and sector in terms of decision making, getting motivated and confident. Alternative titles are introduced as users sometimes type a keyword but that is not included within main title but alternative title and shows visibility. This is supported as how the search mechanics work since they are showing more results outside the specific domain based on keywords.</p>
<h3>Research Findings</h3>
<p>A number of iterations were tested on 1-1 usability sessions to finalise the amount of information we would like to display on the search results in order to help users find what  they are looking for  but at  the same time not overload them with information at that stage. Analytics show that customers scroll through the search results and sometimes go into the categories under a result.</p>
