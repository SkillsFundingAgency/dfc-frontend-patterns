<h2>When to use</h2>
<p>This snippet has been designed as an alternative to the default GDS section headers. It provides better clarity to subsections of content within a key area, allowing for large amounts of content to be scanned and consumed more quickly by the user.</p>
<p>It should only be used when the default GDS headings have been tested and proven to make content overwhelming or difficult to understand.</p>

<hr class="govuk-section-break govuk-section-break--m govuk-section-break--visible">

<h2>Research</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>The main section heading follows GDS patterns along with the content text underneath. As the content grew users found it more and more difficult to find the relevant information they wanted. Also visibility of the links to external resources was reduced. We've initially introduced the secondary heading as a means to distinguish the different routes in into a career and used a grey background colour to increase prominence. At a later stage we tested another version with the tertiary section heading that was used for breaking the information down even further in more complex sections.</p>
<h3>Research findings</h3>
<p>A number of different layouts and patterns were tested primarily in 1-1 sessions before concluding on the final design. The main section heading was clearly identified from users to show of the actions needed to go on a career such as 'How to Become', 'What it takes' etc. The secondary section heading was to introduce the means as routes-in such as 'University', 'Apprenticeships' etc. Lastly the tertiary section heading was used to identify further information such as 'entry requirements', 'more information' etc. The broken down sections were tested  with users using a number of representative job profiles. Users were able to recognise and understand they could find the relevant information.</p>
